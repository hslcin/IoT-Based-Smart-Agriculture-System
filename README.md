## **Real-Time Sensor Data Flow**

### **LoRa Device 1** — Light + Motion (PIR) Sensor
- Every **10 seconds**, the **LoRa node (end device)** transmits **sensor data** via **LoRa radio** to a **LoRaWAN Gateway**, which then forwards the data using the **LoRaWAN protocol** to **The Things Network (TTN) network server**.
-  Node-RED **receives data every 10 seconds** via MQTT from **TTN network server**.
-  **Node-RED extracts**:
      - **Light intensity (lux)**
      - **PIR motion status (0/1)**
  -  **Triggers Telegram alert** when **motion is detected** 🚨.
  -  **Stores data in InfluxDB** for long-term analysis and dashboards.

### **LoRa Device 2** — Soil Moisture + Relay (Water Pump)
- Every **10 seconds**, the **LoRa node (end device)** transmits **sensor data** via **LoRa radio** to a **LoRaWAN Gateway**, which then forwards the data using the **LoRaWAN protocol** to **The Things Network (TTN) network server**.
-  Node-RED **receives data every 10 seconds** via MQTT from **TTN network server**.
-  **Node-RED analyzes moisture level**:
      - **If dry**: Check **NEA 2-hour forecast** in Punggol:
        - 🌧️ **Rain expected** → **Do NOT activate pump** (save water).
        - ☀️ **No rain** → **Activate water pump** (send relay ON command + Telegram alert 🚰).
      - **If wet**: **Deactivate pump** (send relay OFF command + Telegram alert 🚱).
    -  **Stores moisture and relay state in InfluxDB** for monitoring and optimization.
- **NEA API**:
    - **2-hour nowcast**: Offers **highly localized, accurate, near-term weather predictions** useful for **irrigation**

## **Enhanced Automation Functions**

To take our smart agriculture system to the next level, we’ve built in **advanced functions** that ensure system reliability, timely alerts, and smart cost management. These functions are designed to monitor sensor communications and calculate water usage costs dynamically.

### **Lux & PIR Watchdog Timer Function**
- **Purpose:**  
  Ensures that the Lux & PIR sensor node is consistently sending data.  
- **How It Works:**  
  - Every time an uplink message is received from the Lux & PIR sensor, any existing timer is cleared and a fresh 40-second timer is started.
  - **If no message is received within 40 seconds:**  
    A Telegram alert is triggered with an attention-grabbing message (e.g., "🚨⚠️ Alert: No uplink message received from Lux & PIR Sensor for more than 40 seconds! ⏰").
- **Impact:**  
  This proactive monitoring guarantees that communication issues are identified immediately, so you’re always in the loop.

### **Moisture Sensor Watchdog Timer Function**
- **Purpose:**  
  Monitors the Moisture Sensor for regular data transmission to ensure sensor reliability.
- **How It Works:**  
  - Every incoming moisture sensor message resets a 40-second countdown timer.
  - **If the Moisture Sensor falls silent for 40 seconds:**  
    A Telegram alert is sent (complete with emoji flair) to notify you of the communication lapse.
- **Impact:**  
  By keeping a vigilant check on sensor activity, this function helps maintain system integrity and prevents unnoticed downtime.

### **Calculate Water Cost Function**
- **Purpose:**  
  Provides real-time insights into irrigation costs, enabling you to manage water resources more efficiently.
- **How It Works:**  
  - **Relay ON (Irrigation Start):**  
    When the water pump is activated (detected by a relay ON command "AQ=="), the function records the timestamp.
  - **Relay OFF (Irrigation End):**  
    When the pump is deactivated (relay OFF command "AA=="), the function calculates:
    - **Duration:** The total time (in minutes) the pump was active.
    - **Water Volume:** Using an assumed flow rate of 0.1 m³/min.
    - **Water Cost:** Multiplying the water volume by a fixed tariff of SGD $1.21/m³.
  - The calculated water cost and irrigation duration are then logged to InfluxDB for cost analysis.
- **Impact:**  
  This smart calculation helps track water usage, reducing wastage and keeping operational costs in check—a critical feature for sustainable agriculture.

## **Smart Automation Logic — End-to-End Flow**

1. **Soil moisture low** ➡️ **Check weather forecast**:
   - **Rain coming**?  **Skip irrigation**, conserve water.
   - **No rain**?  **Irrigate field**, turn pump ON.
2. **Soil moisture high** ➡️ **Turn pump OFF**, prevent overwatering.
3. **Motion detected** ➡️ **Instant Telegram alert**, possible intruder or wildlife.
4. **Every decision and sensor data** ➡️ **Logged to InfluxDB**, visualized in real-time dashboards.

|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **PIR Motion Detected**            | "🚨 PIR Motion Detected Object!"                  |
| **Soil Dry, No Rain Forecasted**   | "Pump Relay On 🚰" (relay activated)              |
| **Soil Wet / Rain Forecasted**      | "Pump Relay Off 🚱" (relay deactivated)           |
| **Relay Status Change**             | Telegram update + InfluxDB log                    |
| **Sensor Inactivity (Watchdog)**    | Timely Telegram alerts to flag communication gaps |
